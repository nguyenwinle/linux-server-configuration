# Linux Configuration Server

In this project, I will be using a Linux virtual machine configurated to support the Item Catalog website. I will then deploy my application and will be learning about using the Apache HTTP Server to develop and maintain an open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX and Windows.
